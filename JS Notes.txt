Variables:-
-variables are container to store data.
-var:to declare variable which is changable.
note: but in ES-6 to new thing came instead of var-
-const & -let.
-const: means constante, which can not change.
-How to set names of variables?
start with digit,underscore or dollar sign only.
-Reserved words in js.
-' ' and " " both can be use in string variable.

Lecture-6
Operators:-    
note: x= x=2 same as x +=2
note: math works in programming as real world mathemetics(base on BODMAS rule).
 
Lecture-7
Data Types:- 
note: there are many types of data types in JS.
note:undefiend,Object & array is also a data type in JS.
note: undefiend:when we creat a variable and do not assign any value.
note: Object Syntax-
  let man{name:"tom",age:50};
note: typeof operator.
note: template lettral concept:-'${x}' 
    -it does not work in " " or ' ' it works only in tilt (tilt sign is:- ` ` )
let x="hello" is correct.
let x='hell"o' is correct.
let x="hel/"lo" is correct.

Lecture-8
Comparison and Logical Oparators:-
- == equal to(yahaa data type nai dekha jata hai)
- === equal value and equal type (yahaa data type dekha jata hai)
- != not equal
- !== not equl value or not equal type(yahaa data type bhi compare kiya jata hai).  
note: and all as java Oparators.

Lecture-9
Conditions:-
- if-else
- if-else-if-else
- nested-if
- turnarry Oparators-  let option = isLogigedin == 1 ? "Logout" : "Login";
                                // condition              true        false
                            document.write(option);
