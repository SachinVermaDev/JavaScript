******************JavaScript Notes*********************
Lecture:5
Variables:-
-variables are container to store data.
-var:to declare variable which is changable.
note: but in ES-6 to new thing came instead of var-
-const & -let.
-const: means constante, which can not change.
-How to set names of variables?
start with digit,underscore or dollar sign only.
-Reserved words in js.
-' ' and " " both can be use in string variable.

Lecture-6
Operators:-
note: x= x=2 same as x +=2
note: math works in programming as real world mathemetics(base on BODMAS rule).

Lecture-7
Data Types:-
note: there are many types of data types in JS.
note:undefiend,Object & array is also a data type in JS.
note: undefiend:when we creat a variable and do not assign any value.
note: Object Syntax-
let man{name:"tom",age:50};
note: typeof operator.
note: template lettral concept:-'${x}'
-it does not work in " " or ' ' it works only in tilt (tilt sign is:- ` ` )
let x="hello" is correct.
let x='hell"o' is correct.
let x="hel/"lo is correct.

Lecture-8
Comparison and Logical Oparators:-
- == equal to(yahaa data type nai dekha jata hai)
- === equal value and equal type (yahaa data type dekha jata hai)
- != not equal
- !== not equl value or not equal type(yahaa data type bhi compare kiya jata hai).
note: and all as java Oparators.

Lecture-9
Conditions:-
- if-else
- if-else-if-else
- nested-if
- turnarry Oparators- let option = isLogigedin == 1 ? "Logout" : "Login";
// condition true false
document.write(option)                                                    ;

Lecture-10:Switch in JS
-Default:

Lecture-11:Loop
-while
-do while
-for
etc

Lecture-12:Break, Continue and Nested Loop
-note: ham loop ko name bhi de sakte hain.

Lecture-13: Alert, Prompt and Confirm
-These three Function's are used to interact users.

Lecture-13:Data Type Conversion
-typeof
-NaN
-Three Function's we have:
1.String()
2.Number()
3.Boolean()

Lecture-14:String Manipulation
-`` is called back-tic
-template lateral concept
-special character's: \t \\ \n \"
-to know length of text: variable.length
-JS is case sensitive.
-Pre-defined Function's for String-Manupulation:
variable1.concat(variable2)
substr(parameter1,parameter2)
substring(parameter1, parameter2)
indexOf(parameter)
indexOf(parameter1, parameter2)                  ;
lastIndexof()                                    ;
trim()
trimStart()
trimEnd()
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()
replace(parameter1,parameter2)
includes(parameter1)

Lecture-16: array
eg.1:- let students=["Sachin", "Akshay", "Vijay"];
eg.2:- let students=new Array("Sachin", "Akshay", "Vijay");
console.log(students[index number ])                                              ;
or
console.log(students)                                                             ;
Lecture-17:Operations on Array
array.push("one more element name")--to add new element in array in last.
array.un-shift("one more element name")--in last.
array.pop("delete last element in array")
array.shift("delete element in array from begining")
array.splice(parameter1,parameter2)--to remove elements from between in the array
array.length=o                                                                    ; or array=[]--to make array empty
array.indexOf()
Array.isArray(variableName)
variable.split(parameter)-- we can break text into words
variable.join(parameter)--to join words into text
we can add two or more than two arrays (using .concat())
Multi-di-mentional Array:
note:String basically an array of character's

Lecture-18:Functions
Two types of functions-1.pre-defined 2. user-defiened function

Lecture-19:Parameters and Arguments

Lecture-20:The Arguments Object

Lecture-21:Return in Function

Lecture-22:Global variable vs Local variable

Lecture-23:Anonymous Function
when we do not declare any name for function.
when we declare a variable instead of giving function name
it is also called function expression.
why we use it-
setTimeout(FunctionName, Time)

Lecture-24:Immediately invoked function
when we create an Anonymous Function and at that point of time we
invoke that function is called Immediately invoked Function.
bassically we use these things to make our code efficient.
also to reduce conflict of code.

Lecture-25:Object in JavaScript
1.should have property
2.should have any action/Function

Lecture-26:Methods in Object
we can define methods with defferent ways

Lecture-27: 'this' keyword in java

Lecture-29: Math Object
Math Object have many functions-
.round(parameter)
.ceil(parameter)
.floor(parameter)
.trunc(parameter)
.pow(parameter)
.sqrt(parameter)
.min(parameter)
.max(parameter)

Lecture-30: Random number
Math.random()

Lecture-31: Date Object
it has many functions
.getTime()
.getFullYear()
.getMonth()
.getDate()
.getHours()
.getMinutes()
.getSeconds()
.getDay()

.setSeconds()
note: .set___() .get___() in blank space we can write the name of Date object methods

How to compare dates?

Lecture-32: "new" keyword

Lecture-33: Property getters and setters
Re-Understand it.

Lecture-34: Object constructor function
Re-Understand it.

Lecture-34: Object Prototype

Lecture-35: Nested object

Lecture-36: Hoisting

***********Basic Complete************

Lecture-38: Document Object Model(DOM)
-the DOM is an API for manipulating HTML and XML document. (add, remove, and modify parts of the document/HTML)
-when a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page
-Note: In this DOM tree, the document is the root node or object.
-with the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
JS can change all the HTML elements in the page.
JS can change all the HTML attributes in the page.
JS can change all the CSS styles in the page.
JS can remove existing HTML elements and attributes.
JS can add new HTML elements and attributes.
JS can react new HTML events in the page.
NOTE: in the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. so it will
have both property and methods
-the document object represents your web pages
-if you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

Lecture-39: select an element by "ID"
let xyz=document.getElementById("abcId");

Lecture-40: select an element by "Class Name"
let xyz=getElementsByClassName("Class-Name");
note:using it we can select multiple element.

Lecture-41: select an element by "Tag Name"
let xyz=getElementByTagName("Tag-Name");

Lecture-42: QuerySelector() and QuerySelectorAll()

Lecture-43: Traversing elements
also we can select parent using parentSelector
also we can select child element using childSelector
let xyz=elm.children                                                                    ;
also we can select siblings elements using: previousElementSiblings, nextElementSibling

Lecture-44: innerHTML
using it we can do two thing-
1-change all the html inside the element.
2-can fetch all the html.

Lecture-45: Create and Append element
let x=document.createTextNode("xyz");
variable.appendChild(x)               ;

Lecture-46: Insert Before

Lecture-47: Remove Child element

Lecture-48: Clone Element

Lecture-49: Replace Element

Lecture-50: Insert AdjacentHTML

Lecture-51: Change attribute

Lecture-52: Inline styles

Lecture-53: Get computed CSS

Lecture-54: CSS Classes

Lecture-55: Width and Height of an Element

Lecture-56: DOM Events
DOM events are actions that occur as a result
of the user action or as result of state change
of the elements of a DOM tree.
Example of HTML events:-
-When a user clicks the mouse
-When a web page has loaded
-When an image has been loaded
-When the mouse moves over an element
-When an input field is changed
-When an HTML form is changed
-When an HTML form is submitted
-When a user strokes a key

Lecture-57: Remove EventListener

Lecture-58: Page Load Events
DOMContentLoaded:-the browser fully loaded HTML and
completed building the DOM tree. However, it hasn't
loaded external resources like stylesheets and images. in
this event, you can start selecting DOM nodes or
initialize the interface.
load:-the browser fully loaded the HTML and also external resources
like images and stylesheets.
When you leave the page, the following events fire in sequence:

Lecture-59: Mouse Events

Lecture-60: Key Down Event 

Lecture-61: Scroll Events

Lecture-62: Input Events

Lecture-63: Event Bubbling and Event Capturing

Lecture-64: Prevent Default

Lecture-65: Browser Object Model(BOM)

Lecture-66: Window

Lecture-88: ES6- Object Oriented programming
Understand Object Oriented Programming in real lastIndexof
Three important words to Understand
1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance  

in this world every thing is an object (Living things and non living things)
Example: Sachin (man), Honda city (car)
Every object has 2 things:
1.Features or Properties
2.Actions performed by or Performed on it
Sachin(man)--->
1.Features or Properties:- full name, height, weight, age
2.Actions:- walk ,eat ,sleep
Honda city(car)--->
1.Features or Properties:- name, color, model, Background
2.Actions:- drive, repair, fuel, filling
Inheritance:-

Lecture-89: ES6 Object Oriented Programming
understand OOP in programming 
(procedural vs object oriented)
-in OOP Concept we group function and variable in a Block Called Class
-This is not the Exact Syntax
-Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming
(Important for interview)
1.Encapsulation:- means wrapping up data and member function(Method) 
together into a single unit i.e. class.
2.Abstraction:- Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary information
features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant
. For example to open your TV we only have a power button, it is 
not required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV 
remote control.
3.Inheritance:- it allows a class(subclass) to acquire the properties and
behavior of another class(super-class). it helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing code.
SO it helps to write a code accurately and reduce the development time.
4.Polymorphism:- So Polymorphism means "many forms" . A subclass can define its own unique
behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.
