   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
     - **Technologies:** Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions for automating the deployment process.

7. **Maintenance:**
   - **Technologies:** Logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana),
 bug tracking tools (e.g., Bugzilla, Jira), version control systems (e.g., Git) for managing code changes.

Please note that the choice of technologies can vary based on your preferences, project requirements, 
and the specific needs of your team. The mentioned technologies are popular choices, 
and there are many alternatives available for each phase of the SDLC. Additionally, technology stacks 
may differ based on whether you are working in a frontend, backend, or full-stack development role.
